<p>
    I am currently a third-year PhD student in Information Systems at  <a href="https://www.stern.nyu.edu/"> Stern School of Business </a>, New York University.
</p>

<p>
My research interests in general lie at the intersection of economic and technical aspects of technology.
I am especially interested in understanding human decision making in both online and offline settings and aim for providing
better personalized marketing tools in practice. I am enthusiastic about applying interdisciplinary methods to address business problems in real world. Specifically, I focus on mining ubiquitous unstructured data such
as video, image and text in an interpretable and automatic way, and leveraging interdisciplinary methods including
deep learning, causal inference, structural modeling and field experimentation to design and validate marketing tools.
